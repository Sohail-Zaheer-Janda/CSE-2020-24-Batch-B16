# Abstact

Now-a-day’s people are more concern about security of their valuable things. As security towards our valuable things is at most risk because we are using bank as safer place. This project addresses the critical issue of bank locker security by using an innovative system. This project uses biometric data like face, and fingerprints to make sure only authorized people can access bank lockers. ESP32 cameras are used for real-time face detection and tracking. Adding fingerprint scanning adds an extra layer of security by confirming user’s identities. The system is also improved by GSM technology, which can quickly send notifications to authorized users if someone tries to access the locker without permission. By bringing together these technologies, this project provides a complete solution to enhance bank locker security and better protect people's valuable belongings.
